# Contributing to PixCloak

Thanks for your interest! We welcome issues and PRs.

## Workflow

- Fork and create feature branches from `main`
- Keep PRs small and focused; add before/after screenshots for UI
- Run `npm run dev` locally; ensure no ESLint errors

## Code style

- TypeScript strict; functional components; no heavy state libs
- Prefer local state or light Context; add comments for non-trivial logic

## Security / Privacy

- Do not submit secrets or analytics tokens
- All image processing must remain local (no uploads)
