        { question: "How do I use the generated sprite sheet?", answer: "Download the sprite sheet image and JSON mapping file. Use CSS background-position with the coordinates from JSON to display individual images." },
        { question: "Can I customize the grid layout?", answer: "Yes. Set columns, spacing, and padding. The tool automatically arranges images in rows and columns with your specified spacing." },
        { question: "What image formats are supported?", answer: "Supports PNG, JPG, WebP, and other common formats. Output is always PNG for transparency support." }
