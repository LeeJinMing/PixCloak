        { question: "How small are LQIP files?", answer: "Typically 1-3KB as Base64 strings, compared to full images that can be 100KB-1MB. They load instantly and provide visual context." },
        { question: "How do I use LQIP in my website?", answer: "Embed the Base64 string directly in your HTML as a data URL, or use it as a background-image in CSS while the main image loads." },
        { question: "What's the difference between LQIP and blur-up?", answer: "LQIP shows a blurred version of the actual image, while blur-up uses a solid color placeholder. LQIP provides better visual context." }
