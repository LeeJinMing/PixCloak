          { question: "Is WebP better than JPEG?", answer: "For file size, yes. WebP produces 30-50% smaller files at equivalent quality. For compatibility, JPEG is still more universal, especially for older browsers and software." },
          { question: "When should I use JPEG instead of WebP?", answer: "For email attachments (Outlook preview issues), printing, or when targeting users with older devices (pre-2015). For web use, prefer WebP with JPEG fallback." },
          { question: "Does WebP support transparency?", answer: "Yes. WebP supports transparency like PNG, but with better compression. This makes it ideal for logos, graphics, and images with alpha channels." },
