        <h1>Convert JPG to WebP Online</h1>

        <h2>Why Convert JPEG to WebP?</h2>
        <p>
          WebP produces 30-50% smaller file sizes than JPEG at equivalent visual quality. For websites, this means faster page loads,
          lower bandwidth costs, and better Core Web Vitals scores—all of which improve Google search rankings. A typical 500KB JPEG
          becomes 200-250KB as WebP with no visible quality loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google developed WebP specifically for web performance. Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari 14+) support WebP
          natively, covering 95%+ of global users. For the remaining 5%, you can provide JPEG fallbacks using HTML `&lt;picture&gt;` tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond size reduction, WebP supports both lossy and lossless compression, plus transparency (alpha channel) like PNG but with
          better compression. This makes WebP versatile for photos, graphics, logos, and images with transparency—all in one format.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Convert JPEG to WebP: Step-by-Step</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Open the conversion tool</strong>: Visit <a href="/compress">/compress</a> in any browser.
            Works on desktop, mobile, tablet—no app download or account required. All processing happens locally in your browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Upload JPEG images</strong>: Drag and drop JPEG/JPG files, or click &quot;Choose Files&quot; to select from your device.
            You can convert multiple images simultaneously (batch conversion). Files stay on your device—never uploaded to servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Select WebP format</strong>: In the Format dropdown, choose &quot;WebP&quot;. This tells the tool to output WebP instead of JPEG or PNG.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Set quality (optional)</strong>: Quality slider defaults to 85%, which balances size and quality.
            For web use, 75-85% is ideal. For print-quality images, use 90-95%. Lower values = smaller files but visible artifacts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Target file size (optional)</strong>: Enter target KB if you need exact file sizes (e.g., 200KB for uploads).
            The tool automatically adjusts quality to hit the target. This is useful for forms with strict size limits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resize if needed</strong>: For large photos (4000x3000px+), resize longest side to 1920-2560px first.
            This maximizes quality at a given file size. Most screens don&#39;t exceed 1920px width anyway.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Preview and compare</strong>: Toggle between original JPEG and WebP preview. Check &quot;Saved %&quot; indicator to see
            file size reduction. If quality isn&#39;t acceptable, increase quality slider or resize dimensions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Download</strong>: Click &quot;Download&quot; for single files or &quot;Download ZIP&quot; for batch conversions.
            WebP files work in all modern browsers and image editors (Photoshop 23.2+, GIMP, XnView).
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips & Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use 75-85% quality for web</strong>: This range provides best size/quality balance. 85% is nearly indistinguishable from original JPEG but 40-50% smaller.</li>
          <li><strong>Provide JPEG fallback for old browsers</strong>: Use HTML5 `&lt;picture&gt;` tag with WebP source and JPEG fallback. This serves WebP to modern browsers and JPEG to legacy clients.</li>
          <li><strong>Test on actual devices</strong>: WebP quality perception varies by screen. Test on mobile, tablet, desktop to ensure acceptable quality across devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Convert before uploading to CMS</strong>: Convert locally, then upload WebP to WordPress, Shopify, Wix. This gives you control vs. relying on platform compression.</li>
          <li><strong>Batch convert for entire websites</strong>: Convert all site images at once using batch tool. Download as ZIP, extract, then mass-upload to web server.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep JPEG originals</strong>: Store original high-quality JPEGs separately. WebP conversion is lossy—you can&#39;t restore original quality later.</li>
          <li><strong>Use lossless WebP for graphics</strong>: Screenshots, diagrams, UI elements benefit from lossless WebP. Smaller than PNG with no quality loss.</li>
          <li><strong>Check file size after conversion</strong>: Occasionally, complex images may not compress well as WebP. If WebP is larger than JPEG, stick with JPEG.</li>
          <li><strong>Update image URLs in code</strong>: After converting, update HTML/CSS image references from `.jpg` to `.webp`. Use find-and-replace for efficiency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When to Use WebP vs JPEG</h2>
        <p><strong>Use WebP for:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Website images: Hero images, blog photos, product images, thumbnails</li>
          <li>Mobile apps: Faster loading over cellular networks</li>
          <li>Email newsletters: Smaller attachments, faster sending (check recipient email client support)</li>
          <li>Social media: Reduced upload time, faster page rendering</li>
          <li>E-commerce: Product photos, gallery images—faster = higher conversion rates</li>
          <li>CDN delivery: Lower bandwidth costs with same visual quality</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Keep using JPEG for:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Printing: Many print services don&#39;t accept WebP. Use JPEG or TIFF for print.</li>
          <li>Email attachments to general audiences: Outlook 2019 and older don&#39;t preview WebP (downloads as file).</li>
          <li>Older software compatibility: Legacy image editors, design tools may not support WebP.</li>
          <li>When no size constraint: If bandwidth isn&#39;t an issue and compatibility is priority, JPEG is safer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>WebP vs PNG:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>For photos: WebP is 30-50% smaller than PNG. Always choose WebP.</li>
          <li>For graphics with transparency: WebP supports alpha channel and is 20-30% smaller than PNG. Use WebP with fallback.</li>
          <li>For screenshots with text: PNG is slightly sharper for small text. Use PNG for technical documentation, code screenshots.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>WebP Browser Support & Fallbacks</h2>
        <p><strong>Supported browsers (95%+ of users):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Chrome: All versions since 2010 (Chrome 9+)</li>
          <li>Firefox: All versions since 2019 (Firefox 65+)</li>
          <li>Edge: All versions since 2018 (Edge 18+)</li>
          <li>Safari: Version 14+ (2020), macOS Big Sur+, iOS 14+</li>
          <li>Opera: All versions since 2012 (Opera 12+)</li>
          <li>Android Browser: Android 4.0+ (2012)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>HTML fallback example:</strong></p>
        <pre style={{ background: '#f5f5f5', padding: '12px', borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'auto' }}>
          {`<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
</picture>`}
        </pre>
        <p>This serves WebP to supported browsers and JPEG to older ones automatically.</p>
